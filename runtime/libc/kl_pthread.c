// logical mutexes onto one host object whenever guest storage carries a
// stale slot index — memory freed without pthread_mutex_destroy and reused,
// or a live 40-byte bionic mutex memcpy'd into a moved struct. Both were
// observed in one run: the libunity static at libunity+0x1237EE4 and an
// arena object shared slot 23, and the render thread held it via one
// address while the main thread waited via the other — a manufactured
// deadlock (2026-08-06 capture hang). So mutexes are keyed by guest
// *address* instead: a copied or recycled address is the same mutex, a
// different address is a different mutex, and guest storage is never read.
// Keyed by guest ADDRESS, and slots are only reclaimed on an explicit
// pthread_mutex_destroy — which many guests never call (freeing the containing
// object is legal on Linux, where a pthread_mutex_t needs no destroy). So the
// table fills monotonically with the working set of distinct mutex addresses.

// ---------- keys ----------
//
// Guest keys are OURS, not Darwin's, and the difference is the whole point.
//
// The obvious shim — one real pthread_key_create per guest key — spends a
// scarce host resource on an unbounded guest demand, and Darwin's supply is
// smaller than it looks: external keys are handed out from 258 up to 767, so a
// bare process gets 510, and this one is not bare. SwiftUI, Metal, ANGLE and
// MoltenVK all claim keys during dyld's initialisation of THEIR images, before
// any guest code runs, and kl_x18 deliberately claims a high one for itself
// (KLX_TSD_SLOT). Whatever is left is what a whole Android game engine gets.
//
// It is not enough. Asgard's Wrath 2 exhausted it during its first map load,
// and the way that failure presents is the reason this table exists rather
// than a bigger ceiling: a guest does not handle EAGAIN from pthread_key_create
// in any useful way. UE4's FPhysScene_PhysX::InitPhysScene stores -1 for the
// failed key and carries on, and FPhysXCPUDispatcher::submitTask then does
//
//     ldrsw x8, [x0, #0x84]     // x0 = pthread_getspecific(-1) == NULL
//
// on every nested PhysX task — SIGSEGV at 0x84, three minutes in, in guest code
// a hundred thousand instructions away from the call that actually failed.
// Returning EAGAIN is a correct answer that gets a process killed, so the fix
// is to stop running out.
//
// The old mapping also LEAKED: the index came from a counter that only ever
// went up, so key_delete returned the Darwin key to Darwin and kept the guest
// index forever. A guest that cycles keys — and UE4 cycles one per physics
// scene — walks the ceiling down on its own.
//
// So: one Darwin key holds a per-thread slot array, indices come from a free
// list, and a delete makes every outstanding value stale at once by bumping the
// key's sequence number (bionic's design, and for bionic's reason: POSIX says
// values do not survive a delete, and a recycled index must not hand the next
// owner the last one's pointer).

// Microphone capture — a single opt-in toggle that lets a guest (Steam Link's
// voice chat) reach the headset's microphone. Modelled on KleptonChroma: a
// persisted Codable setting, an env override, and a small panel in the boot
// window, so it is remembered across launches and adjustable while wearing the
// headset.
//
// OFF by default, leaving capture to another app such as Discord. Enabling it
// changes the category from .playback to .playAndRecord and requests recording
// permission. Nothing here engages the microphone — no category
// change, no permission prompt, no capture device presented to the guest —
// until a person turns it on. The C half is kl_audio.c's capture path, armed by
// kl_audio_mic_set_enabled and read by kl_aaudio.c / kl_opensl.c when a guest
// opens an input stream.

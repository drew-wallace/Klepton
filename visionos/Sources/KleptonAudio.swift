/// The audio session — the one part of playback that CoreAudio alone will not

///
/// `runtime/media/kl_audio.c` owns the output unit and the ring, and it is plain C
/// that compiles unchanged for macOS and visionOS. What does *not* port is the
/// session: on macOS there is none, and on visionOS an output unit will
/// initialise, start, report success and produce nothing at all unless an
/// `AVAudioSession` has been configured and activated first. That failure has
/// no error code anywhere in it, which is exactly why this file exists and why
/// it logs what it did.
///
/// The second job here is keeping the stream. visionOS inherits iPadOS's view
/// that audio is a resource the system lends out: an interruption, a route
/// change, a media-services reset or a trip through the background can all
/// take the unit away, and the unit does not always notice — it stays nominally
/// started and simply stops calling back. So there are two independent
/// recoveries, and they are meant to overlap:
///
///   * these notifications, which are precise and occasionally do not arrive;
///   * kl_audio.c's own watchdog on the producer side, which notices a render
///     callback that has stopped arriving and rebuilds the unit regardless.
///
/// Either alone has been enough to lose audio for a whole session on this
/// family of OS. Together, a missed notification costs a half-second gap.

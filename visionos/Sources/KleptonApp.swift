            // Skipped under KL_IMMERSIVE: there the compositor is the frame
            // clock and drives kl_app_lifecycle_begin/_frame itself, and both
            // entries are once-per-process, so running the pump here as well
            // would take the lifecycle's only turn.
            //
            // Which knob asks for it depends on the guest, because a frame
            // budget is meaningless to one that owns its own frame loop. Beat
            // Saber's is KL_FRAMES — nativeRender calls, counted. Steam Link's
            // is KL_SLINK_WAIT — seconds of looper pump, exactly as it is on the
            // command line. Gating both on KL_FRAMES was the first version and
            // it made the window path on that target load the chain, report, and
            // then never call ANativeActivity_onCreate at all: a run that looks
            // finished and never started the activity.
            // ...and whether it is asked for AT ALL differs too. Beat Saber's
            // window path stops at initJni unless KL_FRAMES says otherwise,
            // because continuing is what the gate must not do. Steam Link's has
            // no such reason: its chain report is printed and complete BEFORE
            // the activity starts, so that measurement stays takeable from any
            // run, and stopping there instead would mean the default launch
            // loads the guest and then does nothing at all. So it always runs,
            // bounded by KL_SLINK_WAIT (30 s by default) — bounded rather than
            // open-ended because the media/audio/XR/GL report is written at the
            // END of the pump, and that is the report a working run has no other
            // way of producing.
            //
            // The Unreal guest is the Steam Link arm's shape for the Steam Link
            // arm's reasons: its budget is KL_UE4_WAIT in seconds (a frame count
            // means nothing to a guest that owns its frame loop), and its report
            // is written at the END of the pump, so stopping at the chain would
